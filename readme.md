# ColorPuzzle using Gosu

There's not a lot to say... It's Hampton Catlin's ColorPuzzle done with the Ruby
[Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) Library. I hope he doesn't mind...

## Features to come

#### Some sort of scoring. 

I'm not sure how to score it, obviously fewer moves 
is better, and there is obviously an algorithm to compute the fewest possible
moves for a given grid but it eludes me at the moment.

## Updated in this version

Easy mode, accessed via --easy on the command line. This makes a proportion of
blocks the same colour as one of its neighbours, reducing randomness slightly.
